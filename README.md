# Solar_panel_fault_detection_CNN

****
##Business Problem:
********************
The major problem that can be observed during the manufacturing of solar panels is the internal errors which impact on the output and performance efficiency of the solar panel. So the main focus is to detect such internal defects and help the clients for increasing the efficiency and time period of the solar panel.

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Objective:
**********
The objective of the analysis is to detect the defect in the solar panels and help the clients to reduce the manufacturing errors which helps in achieving higher power generation efficiency and longer panel life.
